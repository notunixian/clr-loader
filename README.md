a simple project i put together within ~30 minutes as an open-source version of the loader that [BlazeBest](https://github.com/BlazeBest) uses for his client [BlazeEngine-IL2CPP](https://github.com/BlazeBest/BlazeEngine-IL2CPP), he sells this due to EAC being added to VRChat.

the code behind this is super easy, and isn't worth selling for something so simple.
